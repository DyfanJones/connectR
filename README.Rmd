## Overview

connectR is a wrapper package built on the packages dplyr and dbplyr connecting to databases using the package DBI, initially using odbc connections. connectR attempts to give a user friendly approach by removing the need to hard code passwords and userid for the connection to databases.

## Usage

The src_connectR function attempts to be as user friendly as possible. By reducing the need of hard coding userid and password. Also defaulting to as standard database.

```{r packages, results="hide", warning= FALSE, message= F}
library(tidyverse)
library(connectR)

src_connectR("PostgreSQL35W")->post
```

**Note: connectR is in it's infancy**
